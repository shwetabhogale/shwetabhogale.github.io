[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD student in the Public Policy program at Harvard. My research interests are centred on questions in environmental and resource economics, development economics, and political economy.\nMy job market paper is about studying the effects of competition for groundwater between districts on resource extraction, agricultural decisions and outcomes and long-term health of resources, in India. In addition to this, I am also developing research on the institutional framework that determines groundwater extraction. Before, the COVID-19 pandemic, I was working on evaluating the impacts of an electoral reform that switched mayoral elections from parliamentary to presidential on political entry and incentives in urban local bodies in Maharashtra. My advisors at Harvard include Professors Rema Hanna (Chair), Emily Breza, Melissa Dell, along with Tavneet Suri at the Sloan School of Management (MIT).\nBefore joining Harvard, I was a research assistant for Professor Tavneet Suri and Dr. Rachel Glennerster through Innovations for Poverty Action. I did my Masters in International and Development Economics at Yale University and have a BA in Economics and Statistics from St. Xavier\u0026rsquo;s College, Mumbai.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student in the Public Policy program at Harvard.
