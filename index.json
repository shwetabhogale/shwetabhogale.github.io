[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD candidate in the Public Policy program at Harvard. My research interests are centred on questions in environmental and resource economics, development economics, and political economy.\nMy job market paper  studies whether the standard tragedy of the commons problem for groundwater is exacerbated by administrative jurisdictions in India. Specifically, we find that when districts overlap competitively with a groundwater resource, they promote water-intensive agricultural practices through their budgetary allocations to policy. My advisors at Harvard include Professors Rema Hanna (Chair), Emily Breza, Melissa Dell, along with Tavneet Suri at the Sloan School of Management (MIT).\nBefore joining Harvard, I was a research assistant for Professor Tavneet Suri and Dr. Rachel Glennerster through Innovations for Poverty Action. I received my MA in International and Development Economics at Yale University and have a BA in Economics and Statistics from St. Xavier\u0026rsquo;s College, Mumbai.\nI will be available for interviews at AEA/ASSA 2022.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in the Public Policy program at Harvard.
