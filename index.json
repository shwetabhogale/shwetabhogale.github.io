[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD candidate in the Public Policy program at Harvard. My research interests are centred on questions in environmental and resource economics, development economics, and political economy.\nMy job market paper is about studying the effects of administrative decentralization on the efficiency of groundwater use. Specifically, I look at how segmentation of groundwater resources facilitates competition and escalates groundwater extraction through agricultural decisions and worsens the long-term health of resources. Before, the COVID-19 pandemic, I was working on evaluating the impacts of an electoral reform that switched municipal mayoral elections from parliamentary to presidential, on political entry and politician incentives, in Maharashtra. My advisors at Harvard include Professors Rema Hanna (Chair), Emily Breza, Melissa Dell, along with Tavneet Suri at the Sloan School of Management (MIT).\nBefore joining Harvard, I was a research assistant for Professor Tavneet Suri and Dr. Rachel Glennerster through Innovations for Poverty Action. I received my MA in International and Development Economics at Yale University and have a BA in Economics and Statistics from St. Xavier\u0026rsquo;s College, Mumbai.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in the Public Policy program at Harvard.
